# git_javascript_password_generator

## Description

I created a portfolio that resembled the one given to us as the example. This portfolio utilized flex properties, semantic elements in the html, and media queries in the css that were new skills learned for this project. Although more than the previously stated was used to create this site, these skills had been demonstrated in the previous homework. 

The portfolio contains my picture, facts about me, my contact information, and a link to my previously refactored site. This portfolio will serve as a baseline, when reworking it in the future to have better structure and more user interactive elements.
